Boston Suburb Housing Dataset: 
Problem: use Boston Housing dataset to discover relationships and find/compare the best algorithm for the dataset using train data then analyzing performance with test data; Objective: find the best fit model that fits the target medv to the features crim, indus, nox, rm, age, dis, rad, tax, ptratio, black, and lstat


Circles and Moons Dataset:
Problem: examine Complementary Slackness then use Support Vector Machine and Multi Layer Perceptron for classification; Objective: compare accuracy and computational cost of SVM and MLP on the dataset for the classification problem and determine the best one


Iris Dataset:
Problem: use Iris dataset to discover relationships and find/compare the best algorithm for the dataset using train data then analyzing performance with test data; Objective: find the best model that fits the target class to the features sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width


Neural Network:
Problem: application and comparison of t-SNE, PCA, and Autoencoder on the mnist dataset. Mnist dataset is comprised of 70,000 handwriting sample of the numbers 0-9; Objective: we will inspect and analyze 2d representation of all numbers then find which numbers are better represented by which technique and why. Comparison and analysis can be found following the implementation of each method.
